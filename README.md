# Ovation - software for digital music stands

Ovation displays sheet music in a full screen window. It uses a simple interface that can be navigated with three keys (or hardware buttons). To allow use with feet, the next page and previous page buttons are mapped to pretty much all keys on the right and left side of the keyboard, respectively.

It can import PDFs as well as image sequences. Ovation tries to handle image sequences intelligently for multi-page songs.
